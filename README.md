# OS-project


We have implemented a simple command line interpreter or shell. It allows users to execute various commands, navigate directories, manipulate files, and perform system-related operations. The shell provides a command history feature and records each command executed.

List of commands
1.	cd: Changes the current working directory.
2.	mkdir: Creates a new directory.
3.	grep: Searches for a pattern in a file.
4.	alarm: Sets an alarm to interrupt the program after a specified time. 
5.	sleep: Suspends the program execution for a specified time.
6.	cat: Displays the contents of a file.
7.	echo: Prints the provided arguments.
8.	touch: Creates an empty file.
9.	copy: Appends the content of one file to another.
10.	GetSystemInfo: Prints system information using the "uname" command.



This is list of special commands that we have implemented that use keywords defined by us to execute them:
1.	Append: it appends a string at end of file
2.	DeleteEmptyFiles: Deletes all empty files in the current directory and its subdirectories.


3.	SortedListWithSize: It provides the list of all files in descending order of current directory.
4.	History: It shows you your history, all commands you executed
